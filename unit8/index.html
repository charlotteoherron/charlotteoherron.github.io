				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello! I'm Charlotte, a 22-year-old Connecticut native who much prefers Vermont. In the past 12 months, I graduated <em>Summa cum laude</em> from Middlebury College, moved to Washington, D.C., and landed a job at a SaaS company called Opower. While pursuing my B.A., I studied Environmental Economics, spent a language-intensive semester abroad in Madrid, Spain, and tutored peers in writing and editing. In the summers, I pursued my passion for langauge through working in journalism and communications. As a senior, I carried out independent research on the potential for offshore wind energy development on the the Atlantic Coast, which sparked my professional interest in the energy sector. The opportunity for growth, innovation, and leadership in the clean technology and energy efficiency spaces is what motivates me today.</p></br>

				<p><span class="green">In My Own Words.</span></br>What's an Environmental Economics degree? It's an interdiscplinary major that involves coursework in policy, literature, economics, and the natural sciences. Think: <em>Silent Spring</em>, Pigouvian taxes, NEPA, ecosystem services, Love Canal, the whooping crane, Kyoto Protocol, etc. </p></br>
				<p>My courses took me to the New Haven and Middlebury Rivers to study insect communities, local farms to evaluate the impact of Tropical Storm Irene on local agriculture, and the capitol building in Montpelier to discuss the demand for a state-wide carbon tax. My experience across the disciplines has positioned me to tackle complex environmental issues with a unique understanding of the myriad of factors involved. Additionally, I worked closely with several computer programs, including STATA, IDRISI, ArcGIS and Quantum GIS.</p></br>
				<p>While not in class, I enjoyed the Vermont outdoors, namely through skiing, hiking, and running. I also worked as a a Peer Writing Tutor for the College's Center for Teaching Learning and Research (CTLR). Each semester, I was assigned an introductory writing course of over 20 students. I met with them weekly and became their mentor for writing and editing, as well as time management skills.

				<h4>Regional Analysis of the Benefits and Costs of Solar: Where Investing in Solar is Smart</h4>
				<p>The first project is an independent study on the opportunities and challenges of Atlantic offshore wind development in the U.S., based upon the lessons learned from the Cape Wind Project. The second example is the 60-page Independent Study I wrote on the opportunities and challenges of Atlantic offshore wind development in the U.S., based upon the lessons learned from the Cape Wind Project in Nantucket Sound. This paper required extensive research on the anticipated economic and environmental impacts of offshore wind farms, and it concludes with several policy recommendations to address barriers to offshore wind and clean energy development.</p>

				<h3>Environmental Studies Senior Seminar</h3>
				<h4>Vermont's Clean Energy Future</h4>
				<p>In fall 2013, I was a member of a group project that partnered with the Vermont Council on Rural Development to envision the next steps for Vermont's clean energy future, which involves drafting a carbon-pricing policy and budgeting structure to reduce the state's contribution to climate change. Both of these projects have required extensive research on environmental policy and ecological impacts, as well as analytical and independent thinking. Through evaluating existing carbon-pricing mechanisms, as well as interviewing VT policy makers and stakeholders, we drafted a carbon-pricing policy and budgeting structure to reduce the stateâ€™s contribution to climate change.</p>
