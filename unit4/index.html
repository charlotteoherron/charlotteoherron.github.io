			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hello! I'm Charlotte, a 22-year-old Connecticut native who much prefers Vermont. In the past 12 months, I graduated <em>Summa cum laude</em> from Middlebury College, moved to Washington, D.C., and landed a job at a SaaS company called Opower. Prior to that, I was tremendously enjoying my Environmental Studies courses, perfecting my Spanish, and gaining experience in journalism and communications. As a senior at Middlebury, I carried out independent research on the potential for offshore wind energy in the U.S., and I am more broadly motivated by the myriad of energy challenges we face today. All in all, I want to leverage my liberal arts background to excel in the clean technology and energy efficiency space.</p>
